  <h1>JS Design Patterns</h1>

    <li>
      We have an apartment with old power socket.
      You should implement the ability to plug socket with different standards of shape and voltage (e.g. USA, China, etc.).
      So, your entity should perform some transformation to fit old power socket.

      We have bookmakerâ€™s companies with a lot of kinds of sport and games.
      There are players who can make a bet for the special game and follow the result.
      When this game is finished, each player who was made a bet to this game will receive notification about his gain or loss.

      Let's imagine you come to a ski resort. You should go in some place and rent a skiing.
      Then, you should go to another place and buy a ticket to a ski lift. And of course, you should rent an apartment for your rest.
      Implement an ability which allows people can make all of this things in one place, only entering their own personal data
      (height, age, gender).  Some terminal box to buy or rent those things.

      There is some logistics company. The company can transport parcels by cars and ships.
      In the future, the company wants to grow and add some new type of transport. You should consider this possibility.
      When a person creates a package, he can specify the type of transport. As result in some place of your implementation
      should decide which type of transport should create and use for some parcel.
